### Bible translations have their own licenses

You must still abide by the individual licenses of any Bible translation you use that is accessed via this service. Despite our best efforts, we do not guarantee that our services correctly detect the terms of each translation's license, so you must check them yourself before use.

In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the service or the use or other dealings in the service.
