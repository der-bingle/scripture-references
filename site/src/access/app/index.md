# Web app (UI)

The fetch(bible) web app is a generic bible reading app that can be embedded within your own project, and it can also be customised, and interacted with via Javascript `postMessage` calls.

_Also see the [web enhancer](/access/enhancer/)_

## Example

<iframe src='https://app.fetch.bible'></iframe>


## Features

 * Works offline
 * Swipe to change chapter
 * Scroll through entire books
 * Show multiple translations (both landscape and portrait)
 * Private (no tracking of individuals)

__Coming soon:__

 * Customise font and size
 * Search
 * Audio


## Usage
You can use the app in the following ways:
 1. Embed it as an iframe
    * `<iframe src='https://app.fetch.bible'>`
 1. Load it in a webview in a native app
 1. Navigate to the app and provide a back URL
    * e.g. `https://app.fetch.bible/#back=https://example.com`
    * Doesn't support interaction via `postMessage`
 1. Self-host on your own subdomain
    * `npm install @gracious.tech/fetch-app`
 1. Extend the app with your own components/routes
    * [Written in Typescript/Vue](https://github.com/gracious-tech/fetch/tree/master/app)


## Customisation
You can pass config to the app when it first loads via search params embedded within the `#` of the URL. They should be in the same format as regular search params (i.e. you can use `URLSearchParams` to create them).

**Example:** https://app.fetch.bible/#back=true&dark=true&search=exo10:1


## Interaction
If you embed the app as an iframe or webview then you can use Javascript `postMessage` calls to change the app's config at runtime and also get status updates about what passage the user is reading and some actions they take.

## Params
These are the params available for use in the URL `#` and/or `postMessage` calls:

Param           | Type          | Default        | Description
| -             | -             | -              | -
`dark`          | `true\|false` | `[auto]`       | Whether to force dark/light theme. Only use this if your app already has a theme setting that you want to sync with, and also update it by listening for changes via this app's own theme setting).
`status`        | `string`      | `[disabled]`   | A status message to display in the toolbar (must be short and may get cut off).
`hue`           | `0 - 360`     | `290`          | Color hue for app's theme.
`saturation`    | `20 - 80`     | `70`           | Color saturation for app's theme (limited to 20-80% for readability).
`back`          | `true\|URL`   | `false`        | Whether to show a back button in the toolbar (iframes should listen to click via postMessage, don't use URL if using an iframe/webview).
`button1_icon`  | `coordinates` | `[disabled]`   | The icon to display for a custom button in the toolbar. It must be a string for an SVG `<path d="">` that must conform to a 48x48 viewport (any value from a [Material icon/symbol](https://fonts.google.com/icons) will work).
`button1_color` | `CSS color`   | `currentColor` | A color for the button's fill.
`trans`         | `lll_ttt`     | `[auto]`       | A translation to force use of (comma-separate for multiple). Must be a fetch(bible) id ([preview any translation](/content/bibles/) to find the id in the url).
`search`        | `string`      | `[auto]`       | A passage reference in the language of the given translations (English names and book codes always work, e.g. `Genesis 1:1`).


## Messages

### From the app
Every message sent from the app via `postMessage` contains the following data. The event type is the most important but every event also reports what the user is currently reading.

Property        | Type      | Description
| -             | -         | -
type            | `ready\|translation\|verse\|back\|button1\|dark` | The event type
languages       | `[string, ...]` | The three char language codes (ISO 639â€‘3) of the translations being viewed
translations    | `[string, ...]` | The translations currently being used (always at least one)
book            | `bbb`     | [USX bible book code](https://ubsicap.github.io/usx/vocabularies.html#usx-vocab-bookcode) (in lowercase)
chapter         | `number`    | Chapter number currently being viewed
verse           | `number`    | Verse number currently being viewed
dark            | `true\|false` | Whether the app's theme is dark (or light)

When the app is ready to receive messages it will emit the `ready` event. Whenever the user scrolls or changes book the `verse` event will emit (may be very frequent). Other events trigger for button clicks or other state changes.

### To the app
You can use `postMessage` to send the app a message with `{"type": "update", ...}` and add any of the config params you'd like to change.

```js
window.addEventListener('message', event => {

    // Only handle events from fetch(bible) app
    const app_origin = 'https://app.fetch.bible'
    if (event.origin !== app_origin){
        return
    }

    // Once app is ready, update the status text
    if (event.data.type === 'ready'){
        // Send an update command to the app
        event.source.postMessage({type: 'update', status: "Custom text"}, app_origin)
    }

    // If user clicks back button in app, hide the app
    if (event.data.type === 'back'){
        my_method_to_hide_iframe()
    }
})
```


## Offline support
The app will work offline by default on most devices, however there are some situations that it won't. If a user has disabled third-party cookies in their browser it can prevent iframes from caching responses (even though the app doesn't use any actual cookies).

If this is a problem you should use a method other than iframes to include the app in your own project.
